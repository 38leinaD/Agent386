* Familiarized with Webstorm for development
* Set up basic template based on Mozilla-Mortar template and WebGL
    * Also set up asset-pipeline with Makefile and python scripts
* Rendering of textured quad
* Integrated Resig's classical inheritance model and already set up basic scene-structure
* Implemented AssetManager for loading .json files and .pngs
* Implemented fnt2json to convert BitmapFont definition files to JSON

* Common Problems:
    * Closures have function- and not block-scope! Important to remember when creating/registering event-handlers in loop (variable in loop has value set in last loop iteration)

* Next Todo:
    * Implement BitmapFont Renderer
    * Refactor and generalize Shader and Renderer classes; use proposal from "OpenGL Insights" book
